# CutMyPizza

An app to show you how to cut your pizza, by pointing your camera.

I had problems in my family with cutting pizza's in equal pieces so I got the idea to make an app that would show me where to cut the pizza, by pointing your camera at it.

I also added some animations in the background and start page to give it a more positive vibe.


This idea popped up a while ago so I made a project but never got to it.
